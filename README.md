# OpenBase
An omnidirectional mobile platform, with a 3 omnidirectional wheels layout, with two objectives: to facilitate the development of mobile robot control algorithms and to facilitate the development of mobile robots in general by providing a ready to use movement solution.

It is free and open source, licensed with the MIT/Expat license, with the intent of powering the research of robotics anywhere for anyone.

It’s provided with tutorials and the code is commented and modularized, to facilitate the work with it as much as possible.

It is the result of my final graduation work in Computer Engineering and, as such, it has a lot of scientific research behind it. I could make it available here too, but it's in Portuguese, and i would have to translate about 50 pages to English, so it will not come in the near future.

The idea was to make a physical model, also with all the necessary instructions, but the hardware didn’t arrive in time, so only the simulation part for validation has been developed.

It uses the Gazebo simulator, so you need to know how to use it first. I recommend [1] and [2] and skimming over [3] is good.

It’s also a good idea to at least superficially understand the kinematics. The works of [4] and [5] are very good starting points and are freely available online.

Given the purpose of this work, I may improve it in the future with more advanced features like a dynamic model instead of a kinematic model or better movement control, but since this is an open project, please do contact me (or use the available GitHub funcionalities) to improve this work so everyone can have an even better experience, specially if it’s a bug fix or a correction in the text of the tutorials.
